Open each of the XMLs in a text editor or XML editor, I use XML Copy Editor and Notepad.  

For actions.xml, heroes.xml, villains.xml, items.xml, chapters.xml, statuses.xml, and missions.xml

Search for dispName and replace between the > and < 
<dispName>Dance of Blood</dispName>  is the first one in actions.
Replace "Dance of Blood" with the translated text.

Continue to do this for every entry of <dispName>

Do the same for <description>

save as an xml.


For Dialog Groups.xml  you need to replace, <displayName> and <message>.

For locale strings.xml you need to replace <text>.  Do not replace items in between { and }.


If a text is in all caps replace with all caps.
